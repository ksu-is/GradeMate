# GradeMate
This is a program to help students track their grades and calculate their overall class average. Users can enter up to the desired number of assignments per class, and the program will display the final numeric average and the corresponding letter grade.



# Features 

• Input up to desire assigments with grade.

• Calculates weighted average grade.

• Converts numeric grade to letter grade (A–F).


# Update 7/18/25 

In improving my grade calculator, I made several changes to enhance its functionality and usability. I added input checks so the user must enter valid numbers, which helps avoid crashes. I also let users choose how many assignments they have instead of using a fixed number. I moved the letter grade function outside the loop and added messages to show grades right away. I made the average scores show only two decimal places to look cleaner. One big update was saving all results, class names, averages, and letter grades to a text file, which helps keep records. I also added better comments and made the code easier to read and update in the future. I believe these changes made the program more useful, flexible, and user-friendly.
